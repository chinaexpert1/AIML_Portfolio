    "For this assignment you will be implementing and evaluating a Naive Bayes Classifier with the same data from last week:\n",

    "    <p>\n",
    "        No Pandas. The only acceptable libraries in this class are those contained in the `environment.yml`. No OOP, either. You can used Dicts, NamedTuples, etc. as your abstract data type (ADT) for the the tree and nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll first need to calculate all of the necessary probabilities using a `train` function. A flag will control whether or not you use \"+1 Smoothing\" or not. You'll then need to have a `classify` function that takes your probabilities, a List of instances (possibly a list of 1) and returns a List of Tuples. Each Tuple has the best class in the first position and a dict with a key for every possible class label and the associated *normalized* probability. For example, if we have given the `classify` function a list of 2 observations, we would get the following back:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[(\"e\", {\"e\": 0.98, \"p\": 0.02}), (\"p\", {\"e\": 0.34, \"p\": 0.66})]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "when calculating the error rate of your classifier, you should pick the class label with the highest probability; you can write a simple function that takes the Dict and returns that class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the Naive Bayes Classifier generates the *unnormalized* probabilities from the numerator of Bayes Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(C|A) \\propto P(A|C)P(C)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where C is the class and A are the attributes (data). Since the normalizer of Bayes Rule is the *sum* of all possible numerators and you have to calculate them all, the normalizer is just the sum of the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have the same basic functions as the last module's assignment and some of them can be reused or at least repurposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`train` takes training_data and returns a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a data structure. There are many options including namedtuples and just plain old nested dictionaries. **No OOP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def train(training_data, smoothing=True):\n",
    "   # returns the Decision Tree.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `smoothing` value defaults to True. You should handle both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`classify` takes a NBC produced from the function above and applies it to labeled data (like the test set) or unlabeled data (like some new data). (This is not the same `classify` as the pseudocode which classifies only one instance at a time; it can call it though).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def classify(nbc, observations, labeled=True):\n",
    "    # returns a list of tuples, the argmax and the raw data as per the pseudocode.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`evaluate` takes a data set with labels (like the training set or test set) and the classification result and calculates the classification error rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$error\\_rate=\\frac{errors}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use anything else as evaluation metric or the submission will be deemed incomplete, ie, an \"F\". (Hint: accuracy rate is not the error rate!).\n",
    "\n",
    "`cross_validate` takes the data and uses 10 fold cross validation (from Module 3!) to `train`, `classify`, and `evaluate`. **Remember to shuffle your data before you create your folds**. I leave the exact signature of `cross_validate` to you but you should write it so that you can use it with *any* `classify` function of the same form (using higher order functions and partial application). If you did so last time, you can reuse it for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Module 3's discussion, `cross_validate` should print out the fold number and the evaluation metric (error rate) for each fold and then the average value (and the variance). What you are looking for here is a consistent evaluation metric cross the folds. You should print the error rates in terms of percents (ie, multiply the error rate by 100 and add \"%\" to the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize...\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm to the Mushroom data set using 10 fold cross validation and the error rate as the evaluation metric. You will do this *twice*. Once with smoothing=True and once with smoothing=False. You should follow up with a brief explanation for the similarities or differences in the results."
