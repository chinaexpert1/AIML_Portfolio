    "        No Pandas. The only acceptable libraries in this class are those contained in the `environment.yml`. No OOP, either. You can used Dicts, NamedTuples, etc. as your abstract data type (ADT) for the the tree and nodes.\n",

    "</div>\n",

    "One of the things we did not talk about in the lectures was how to deal with missing values. There are two aspects of the problem here. What do we do with missing values in the training data? What do we do with missing values when doing classifcation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different ways that we can handle this.\n",
    "A common algorithm is to use something like kNN to impute the missing values.\n",
    "We can use conditional probability as well.\n",
    "There are also clever modifications to the Decision Tree algorithm itself that one can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to do something simpler, given the size of the data set: remove the observations with missing values (\"?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You must implement the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`train` takes training_data and returns the Decision Tree as a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def train(training_data):\n",
    "   # returns the Decision Tree.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`classify` takes a tree produced from the function above and applies it to labeled data (like the test set) or unlabeled data (like some new data).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def classify(tree, observations):\n",
    "    # returns a list of classifications\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`evaluate` takes a data set with labels (like the training set or test set) and the classification result and calculates the classification error rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$error\\_rate=\\frac{errors}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use anything else as evaluation metric or the submission will be deemed incomplete, ie, an \"F\". (Hint: accuracy rate is not the error rate!).\n",
    "\n",
    "`cross_validate` takes the data and uses 5x2 fold cross validation (from Module 2!) to `train`, `classify`, and `evaluate`. **Remember to shuffle your data before you create your folds**. I leave the exact signature of `cross_validate` to you but you should write it so that you can use it with *any* `classify` function of the same form (using higher order functions and partial application).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Module 2's material (course notes), `cross_validate` should print out a table in exactly the same format. What you are looking for here is a consistent evaluation metric cross the folds. Print the error rate to 4 decimal places. **Do not convert to a percentage.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def pretty_print_tree(tree):\n",
    "    # pretty prints the tree\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be a text representation of a decision tree trained on the entire data set (no train/test).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize...\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the Decision Tree algorithm to the Mushroom data set using 5x2 cross validation and the error rate as the evaluation metric. When you are done, apply the Decision Tree algorithm to the entire data set and print out the resulting tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** Because this assignment has a natural recursive implementation, you should consider using `deepcopy` at the appropriate places.\n"

    "With n fold cross validation, we divide our data set into n subgroups called \"folds\" and then use those folds for training and testing. You pick n based on the size of your data set. If you have a small data set--100 observations--and you used n=10, each fold would only have 10 observations. That's probably too small. You want at least 30. At the other extreme, we generally don't use n > 10.\n",
